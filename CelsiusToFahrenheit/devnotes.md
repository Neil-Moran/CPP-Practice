This is a revisit of the first program I ever wrote in 2012! I think it's a great choice for a beginner as it introduces some good fundamental concepts, and it strikes the right balance of easy to understand but tricky to accomplish quickly without a computer. Good fun to write again! Unlike ten years ago I read the input values from a file this time, it's something I found myself only doing every now and again so I want to practice it a bit more regularly.
