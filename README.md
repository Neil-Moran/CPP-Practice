# C++ Practice

This repo contains several simple C++ projects intended to help me practice my programming skills and tackle some fun problems in the process! Each sub-project has a `devnotes.md` file where I talk about objectives, highlight interesting challenges, explain design decisions, etc. I hope it's interesting!

## Building the source code
I develop using Visual Studio Code, so each sub-project contains:
* a `build.bat` batch file that calls the Microsoft compiler
* a `.vscode` containing JSON files to build and run the program from VS Code

If you want to build a sub-project using another compiler it should hopefully be straight-forward, there are only a few files per project and the compiler arguments are simple enough!

## Special Thanks
Thanks to [Kevin](https://github.com/kevinmoran) for all the feedback, code reviews and fun chats!
